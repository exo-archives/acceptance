   * should return {@code true} if and only if
   * {@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.
   * <li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values
   * {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, if
   * {@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and
   * {@code y.equals(z)} returns {@code true}, then

   * <li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values
   * {@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of
   * {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
   * or consistently return {@code false}, provided no
   * information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the
   * objects is modified.

   * {@code y}, this method returns {@code true} if and only
   * if {@code x} and {@code y} refer to the same object
   * ({@code x == y} has the value {@code true}).

   * <ul>
   * <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
   * an execution of a Java application, the {@code hashCode} method
   * must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
   * used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.
   * This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
   * application to another execution of the same application.
   * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
   * method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
   * the two objects must produce the same integer result.
   * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
   * according to the {@link Object#equals(Object)}
   * method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
   * two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
   * programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
   * for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
   * </ul>
   * <p/>
   * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
   * class {@code Object} does return distinct integers for distinct
   * objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
   * address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
   * technique is not required by the
